# Python Documentation

# Random Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password of a specified length. The password can contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

## Libraries Used

- `string`: This is a built-in Python library that contains a collection of string constants. In this script, it is used to generate a string of ASCII characters, digits, and punctuation.

- `random`: This is another built-in Python library that implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions. In this script, it is used to randomly select characters from the string generated by the `string` library.

## How It Works

The script defines a function `password_generator(length=8, chars=string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation)`. This function generates a password of a specified length. By default, the length is set to 8, but this can be changed by the user. The `chars` parameter is a string that contains all possible characters that can be included in the password.

The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of `length` random characters from `chars`. The `join()` method is then used to convert this list into a string, which is the password.

The script then prints a welcome message and prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password. The `password_generator()` function is called with this length, and the generated password is printed.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in a Python environment. When prompted, enter the desired length of the password. The script will then print a randomly generated password of that length.

# C# Documentation

# CSharp Password Generator

This is a simple console application written in C# that generates a random password of a specified length.

## Script Description

The script prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password. It then generates a random password of that length, using a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, and numbers.

Here is a brief overview of the script:

- The script starts by asking the user to input the desired length of the password.
- This length is then passed to the `GeneratePassword` function.
- The `GeneratePassword` function generates a random password of the specified length. It does this by repeatedly selecting a random character from a predefined string of valid characters, and concatenating these characters together to form the password.
- The generated password is then printed to the console.

## Imported Libraries

The script uses the following libraries:

- `System`: This is a fundamental library in C# that provides core functionalities such as input/output operations, string manipulation, datetime manipulation, etc. In this script, it is used for console input/output operations.

- `System.Linq`: This library provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language-Integrated Query (LINQ). In this script, it is used to generate the random password with the `Enumerable.Repeat` method, which simplifies the process of creating a sequence of random characters.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in a C# compatible environment. When prompted, enter the desired length of the password. The script will then generate and print a random password of that length.

## Code

```CSharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.Write("Enter the length of the password: ");
        int length = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine(GeneratePassword(length));
    }

    static string GeneratePassword(int length)
    {
        const string valid = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890";
        return new string(Enumerable.Repeat(valid, length)
          .Select(s => s[new Random().Next(s.Length)]).ToArray());
    }
}
```

This script is a simple and effective way to generate random passwords in C#.

# Java Documentation

# Java Password Generator

This Java script is a simple yet effective password generator. It generates a random password of a specified length, which includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

## Script Explanation

The script begins by importing the `java.util.*` package, which provides classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java programming language. The most commonly used class in this package is the `Random` class, which is used in this script to generate random numbers.

The `main` method is the entry point for any Java application. In this script, it initializes the length of the password to be generated and then calls the `generatePassword` method with this length.

The `generatePassword` method is where the actual password generation happens. It first defines strings of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. These strings are then concatenated into one string, `values`, which contains all possible characters for the password.

A `Random` object is created, and a for loop is used to select a random character from `values` for each position in the password. The selected character is then added to the `password` array.

Finally, the method returns the `password` array, which contains the generated password.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in your Java environment. The length of the password can be adjusted by changing the `length` variable in the `main` method.

## Libraries Used

- `java.util.*`: This package contains the collections framework, legacy collection classes, event model, date and time facilities, internationalization, and miscellaneous utility classes (a string tokenizer, a random-number generator, and a bit array). In this script, it is used to generate random numbers.
